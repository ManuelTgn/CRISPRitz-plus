    Parameters
    ----------
    sequence: str
        Full genomic sequence (single chromosome, uppercase IUPAC).
    contig: str
        Chromosome / contig identifier used in the output filename(s).
    pam: str
        PAM-only string (e.g. ``"NGG"``), without guide placeholder Ns.
    pam_length: int
        Total length of the PAM + guide pattern.
    pam_size: int
        Length of the PAM portion only.
    upstream: bool
        True when the PAM precedes the guide (e.g. Cas12a).
    outdir: str
        Path to the directory where the genome index will be stored.
    max_bulges: int
        Maximum number of bulges allowed during index construction.
